Resque.Net
===========================

This is intended to be a port of the Ruby version of Resque by defunkt.  

The project has just begun and I'm looking for help.  

Basically I'm looking to follow the design of the Ruby version of Resque pretty closely.

The project is being built on the ServiceStack framework.  

Send me email if you're interested in helping with this effort.
